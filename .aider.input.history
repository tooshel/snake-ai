+ using src/main.js and src/utils.js make a new "snake" game. If I remember right, a new "dot" appears and as a player you chase it to direct the snake to the dot without crossing yourself. Every dot you get you grow one dot longer. I eventually want to make this a two player game so keep that in mind. The second player could use on device controls or connect over a network. this is a canvas only game. only draw to the canvas like you see in the example. no css and no dom!

+ I didn't ask for a grid but you gave me one! I love it. Can the snake start off longer? 4 tiles instead of 1? Also the game ends as soon as I get the red dot and it's only supposed to end if I cross myself. Also, the restart should be "z" or some other button on the controller like left trigger. Even now the Z doesn't work.

+z still in not restarting the game

+z is being overridden by the utils.js . . . just change it to use t to restart

+I added   console.log("handleInput", p1.GUIDE); to the "handleInput" and when the game is over, that function is not being called. Which means that it will never know when you press "start" to reset the game.

+okay, that's great. Now we need a score at the top of the screen. And we could also make the snake move a bit faster after every 5 segments added? make that a variable though. Same with the increase in speed . . . should be able to easily adjust that to tweak the game

+it's nice seeing the score up there, but what about the current speed? maybe call that "level" and also add it to the top. also, I want a nice gaming looking font. use the createResourceLoader function from utils in main and have it load a font. I put a font in public/fonts/PressStart2P-Regular.ttf. to use the font, you should be using a "FontFace" function. I can get you an example if you get confused. 

# 2025-02-20 16:54:49.353686
+I see the level there but can we move it over to the right? also, the font isn't working, do you need help?
